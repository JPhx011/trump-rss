# trump-rss

Automated RSS feed generator for Trump-related and conservative news sources, including official White House news, campaign news, InfoWars breaking news, and aggregated media coverage.

## 📰 Available Feeds

This project generates four RSS feeds that update automatically 4 times daily:

1. **Trump Campaign News** (`trump_feed.xml`)
   - Source: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news
   - Campaign announcements, press releases, and statements

2. **White House News** (`whitehouse_feed.xml`)
   - Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/
   - Official presidential actions, briefings, and statements

3. **White House Wire** (`wire_feed.xml`)
   - Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wire/
   - Aggregated news coverage and media mentions

4. **InfoWars Breaking News** (`infowars_feed.xml`)
   - Source: https://www.infowars.com/breaking-news
   - Breaking news and updates from InfoWars

## 🚀 How It Works

The project uses Python web scrapers that run automatically via GitHub Actions:
- **Runs 4x daily** at 2am, 8am, 2pm, and 8pm UTC
- **Auto-commits** updated feeds back to the repository
- **Error-resilient** - if one scraper fails, others continue

## 🛠️ Setup (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Google Chrome (for Selenium-based scrapers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JPhx011/trump-rss.git
cd trump-rss
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run individual scrapers:
```bash
# Trump campaign news
python scrape_trump_campaign.py

# White House news
python scrape_whitehouse.py

# Wire aggregator
python scrape_wire.py

# InfoWars breaking news
python scrape_infowars.py
```

The scrapers will generate `.xml` files in the project directory.
